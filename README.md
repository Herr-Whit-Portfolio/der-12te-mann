# der-12te-mann
A German-Language chatbot informing you about the ins and outs of the Bundesliga

"der-12te-mann" means the 12th man in German. Often this is meant to refer to fans or even the "god of football" in the sports' context.

## Aim
The goal of this project (no pun intended) is to develop a informal chatbot, which will inform you about the 1st German Football Bundesliga activity and scores.
This should include:
- Standings of Teams 
- Scores of past Games
- Upcoming Games

Additionally the Bot should handle basic conversational elements like greetings, goodbyes etc.

## Technology

The Chatbot will be based on the [RASA](https://rasa.com/docs/) Framework.
For the retrieval of football-related info, I intend to use [Openliga](https://www.openligadb.de/).

Relevant software, which might become useful at a later stage:
- spacy
- NLTK


## Acknlowledgements
I would like to acknowledge Oliver Guhrs contribution and his [german RASA template](https://github.com/oliverguhr/german-rasa-bot), 
which helped me to get going with a basis of German Training Data.
